# Snake_GameCode
Practicing pygame by making a basic snake game this is a WP.
A key factor into making a game needs a library a library is a group of varaibles that the game grabs from that include "color" "background" 
And or "speed" for if you have a player this determins how fast that player will go and "size" determins how big it will be in pixels generaly not sure 
how to be specific in that area just yet.

This is a work in progress anyones welcome to try the code out just make sure you downloaded python3 and pip and after pip pygame!
